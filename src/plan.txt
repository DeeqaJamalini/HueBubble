1- create the buttons
2- design and layout
3- add typescript to everything
4- get rid of css files its not need as sass is a dev dependency



game data:
- create an object that stores 

array of 

color object {

    [
        {
            color: pink
            matcher: yes

        },
        {
            color: purple
            matcher: no
        },
        {
            color: green
            matcher: no
        }

    ]

    [
        {
            color: pink
            matcher: yes

        },
        {
            color: purple
            matcher: no
        },
        {
            color: green
            matcher: no
        }

    ]

}



im currently storing the data inside of the file but in the future I want to refactor the code to create a function that generates the colors


//create a function that keeps track of the games playes and the score of ones correct if you have time
